# python-CLI-based-game
These were the initial python scripts that i made in my initial days of python. There are three games.Tic tact toe, Hangman and a Reversi. Reversi having the most complex A.i of all.

* earlier version was system dependent. Because of one stupid cls(windows) and clear(linux) command
  solved that. Right now should work primarily for linux terminal and windows CLI
